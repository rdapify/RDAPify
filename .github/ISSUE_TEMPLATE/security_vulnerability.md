## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Private Security Reports

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities using public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by:

1. **Email:** Send details to the maintainers (see SECURITY.md)
2. **GitHub Security Advisories:** Use the "Security" tab → "Report a vulnerability"

This ensures the vulnerability can be addressed before public disclosure.
