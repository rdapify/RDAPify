## 🎯 Why Enable Discussions?

GitHub Discussions provides a dedicated space for:
- ❓ **Q&A**: Users can ask questions and get answers
- 💡 **Ideas**: Community can suggest and discuss new features
- 📢 **Announcements**: Share release notes and important updates
- 🙌 **Show and Tell**: Users can showcase their projects using RDAPify

This keeps Issues focused on bugs and feature requests, while Discussions handles community conversations.
