## 📋 Next Steps (Manual Actions Required)

### Step 1: Configure npm Trusted Publisher (RECOMMENDED)

Go to: https://www.npmjs.com/package/rdapify/access

Fill in the form with these exact values:

```
Publisher: GitHub Actions
Organization or user: rdapify
Repository: RDAPify
Workflow filename: release.yml
Environment name: npm-publish
```

Click "Set up connection"

**Why?** This enables secure publishing without storing npm tokens. The workflow already has the correct configuration.

# 🎉 RDAPify v0.1.0 - First Public Release

We're excited to announce the first stable release of **RDAPify** - a unified, secure, high-performance RDAP client for enterprise applications with built-in privacy controls.

## 🚀 What is RDAPify?

RDAPify is a modern TypeScript library that provides a simple, secure way to query domain, IP, and ASN registration data using the RDAP protocol (the modern replacement for WHOIS).

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔍 Universal Queries**: Domain, IPv4, IPv6, and ASN lookups
- **🛡️ Security First**: SSRF protection, certificate validation, input sanitization
- **🔒 Privacy Built-in**: GDPR/CCPA compliant PII redaction
- **⚡ High Performance**: In-memory caching with configurable TTL
- **🎯 Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive types
- **🌐 Auto-Discovery**: Automatic RDAP server discovery via IANA Bootstrap
- **📦 Zero Config**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install rdapify
```

## 🎯 Quick Start

```typescript
import { RDAPClient } from 'rdapify';

const client = new RDAPClient();

// Query a domain
const domain = await client.queryDomain('example.com');
console.log(domain.handle, domain.status);

// Query an IP address
const ip = await client.queryIP('8.8.8.8');
console.log(ip.handle, ip.country);

// Query an ASN
const asn = await client.queryASN(15169);
console.log(asn.handle, asn.name);
```
