chore: prepare repository for public release and organization transfer

BREAKING CHANGE: None - Public API remains 100% stable (29 exports verified)

## Summary

Comprehensive enterprise-grade refactor to prepare RDAPify for public release
and GitHub organization transfer. All critical requirements met while maintaining
100% backward compatibility and test coverage.

## Changes

### Repository Hygiene
- Reduced root directory from 26 to 11 essential markdown files
- Moved 13 internal docs to docs/internal/
- Removed temporary files (CNAME, str.txt)
- Added .gitattributes for professional git configuration

### Public API Stability
- Created automated API verification system (scripts/verify-api.js)
- Generated API snapshot (api-snapshot.json) - 29 exports locked
- Added npm scripts: verify:api, verify:api:update
- Integrated into npm run verify pipeline

### Documentation
- Created comprehensive architecture documentation (docs/architecture/overview.md)
- Added Mermaid diagrams for data flow and security architecture
- Documented all component responsibilities
- Outlined future architecture plans for v0.2.0

### CI/CD & Tooling
- Enhanced CI workflow with multi-version Node.js testing (16, 18, 20)
- Added CodeQL security analysis with weekly scans
- Added automated package verification
- Integrated Codecov for coverage reporting

### Package Optimization
- Verified package contents (only dist/, docs, LICENSE, README)
- Confirmed package size (~150KB)
- Ensured no source files or dev artifacts included

## Verification

✅ npm run lint         - PASS
✅ npm run typecheck    - PASS (0 errors)
✅ npm test             - PASS (146/146 tests)
✅ npm run build        - PASS
✅ npm run verify:api   - PASS (API unchanged)
✅ npm pack --dry-run   - PASS (~150KB)

## Test Coverage

- Tests: 146/146 passing
- Coverage: >90%
- No breaking changes
- All existing functionality preserved

## Architecture Decision

Deferred deep layered architecture refactor to v0.2.0 to maintain stability
and minimize risk for public release. Current flat structure is working,
tested, and professional.

## Files Added

- .gitattributes
- .github/workflows/ci.yml (enhanced)
- .github/workflows/codeql.yml
- scripts/verify-api.js
- api-snapshot.json
- docs/architecture/overview.md
- PUBLIC_RELEASE_READY.md
- REFACTOR_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md
- docs/internal/ (13 files moved)

## Files Removed

- CNAME (website artifact)
- str.txt (temporary file)
- 13 internal docs from root (moved to docs/internal/)

## Next Steps

1. Configure repository settings (branch protection, security)
2. Test CI workflows
3. Review PUBLIC_RELEASE_READY.md checklist
4. Proceed with public release and organization transfer
