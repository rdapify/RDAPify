# Project Governance

## Overview

RDAPify operates under a **meritocratic stewardship model** where technical excellence and consistent contributions determine responsibilities.

## Core Principles

- **Security-first architecture**
- **Privacy by default**
- **Protocol compliance** (RFC 7480 series)
- **Open collaboration**
- **Sustainable excellence**

## Structure

### Technical Steering Committee (TSC)
- Makes architectural decisions
- Oversees security and compliance
- Manages releases

### Module Maintainers
- Maintain specific components
- Review and merge PRs
- Ensure code quality

### Contributors

- Participate in discussions
- Help with testing and reviews

## Decision Making

- **Routine**: Maintainers decide
- **Significant**: TSC consensus
- **Architectural**: TSC vote (2/3 majority)
- **Emergency**: TSC Chair authority
